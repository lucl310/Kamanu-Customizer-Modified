either have color buttons and select color then click either ama or deck to change the color OR keep current deck color / hull color buttons

add feature for customers to drag saved designs onto canoe and resize them?!

make 3 buttons, eraser, draw, bucket
simplify the UX

split the shading image into sections based on where the sticker would go
whenever img is dropped over a certain portion of the canoe, it will go to a preset hull placement for that section

can use getimagedata to draw stickers on the canvas or just create a new element
sticker should be able to change color too

have preset drag and drop designs, maybe dont need multiple sections of the shading, just have a div over it that gains z value whenever an image or sticker is being dragged

maybe just remove the show saved designs feature and replace the button with the download button
